I am excited to announce the first official release of the `bmm` R package. The `bmm` package is
designed to make Bayesian measurement modeling in psychology accessible to all. This is work I've
done in close collaboration with [Gidon
Frischkorn](https://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/de/bereiche/nec/allgpsy/team/wissenschaftliche/frischkorn.html)
over the past two years and we are excited to finally share it with the world.

You can install the package from CRAN using the following command:

``` r
install.packages("bmm")
```

You can also find detailed documentation and examples on the [package
website](https://venpopov.github.io/bmm/index.html).

## What is bmm for?

The package provides a simple and intuitive interface for fitting a wide range of measurement models
in psychology using Bayesian methods. It is designed to be accessible to researchers with little to
no experience with Bayesian statistics or cognitive modeling. But first, what is a measurement
model?

Measurement models are used to understand the relationship between latent psychological constructs
and behavioral data. The data we observe are often
noisy and imperfect reflections of the underlying psychological processes we are interested in.
These data also often result from multiple interrelated processes that can be difficult to
disentangle. Measurement models provide a way to model these processes and estimate the underlying
psychological constructs that are driving the observed data.

Measurement models are used in a wide range of psychological research areas. Some of the more
popular models include drift diffusion models in decision making, signal detection theory models in
perception and memory, and mixture models in visual working memory. The basic idea behind all such
models is that we can decompose one or multiple observed measures (e.g., reaction times, accuracy
rates, angular deviation) into latent psychological processes (e.g., decision thresholds, memory
strength) that are not directly observable.

## The challenges of measurement modeling

Traditionally, to fit a measurement model in pscyhology, you usually needed to build it yourself.
The simple reality is that most researchers don't have the time, resources, or expertise to build
and fit these models from scratch. This is doubly true for Bayesian models, which require a
different set of tools and skills than traditional maximum likelihood estimation. And even for those
who do have the skills, the process can be time-consuming and error-prone.

This is in fact why we started working on the `bmm` package in the first place - we were tired of
doing the same thing over and over again for every new project. What started as a personal project
to make our own lives easier has now turned into a full-fledged R package. What we have built is a
package that allows you to fit a wide range of measurement models[^1] with just a few lines of code.
You no longer need to copy paste custom JAGS or Stan code from one project to the next. You no
longer need to worry about whether you have correctly specified your priors or likelihoods. You no
longer need to worry about whether you have correctly implemented your model. You don't have to
worry about how to adjust the script for your new experimental design and to spend hours debugging
it. The `bmm` package takes care of all of that for you.

[^1]: Ok to be fair, when I say "wide-range", I am refering to the potential of the package. The
    package currently supports most models in the domain of visual working memory, but we are
    working on expanding it to other areas as well. But the package is designed to be extensible, so
    you can easily add your own models.

## Example - the Interference Measurement Model

To give you a sense of how easy it is to fit a model using the `bmm` package, let's walk through an
example. Let's say you have collected data from a visual working memory task and you want to fit the
[Interference Measurement Model (IMM)](https://venpopov.github.io/bmm/articles/bmm_imm.html)
[@oberauer2017] to your data.

## Currently supported models

We currently have the following models implemented:

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
bmm::print_pretty_models_md()
```

However, the setup of the bmm package provides the foundation for the implementation of a broad
range of cognitive measurement models. In fact, we are already working on implementing additional
models, such as:

-   Signal-Detection Models
-   Evidence Accumulation Models
-   Memory Models for categorical response

If you have suggestions for models that should be added to the package, feel free to create an issue
on [GitHub](https://github.com/venpopov/bmm/). Ideally this should describe the model, point towards
literature that gives details on the model, and if possible link to code that has already
implemented the model.

Given the dynamic nature the bmm package is currently in, you can always view the latest list of
supported models by running:

``` r
bmm::supported_models()
```
